Algorithms & Assumptions
	Emissions: for now, we'll just track CO2 emissions. other emissions to estmate include N2O, CH4, and HFCs.
	going by http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/420f05004.htm#step1, we'll use a value of 8.788 kg CO2 / gallon gasoline
	
	for now, we're assuming a 2010 Toyota Camry, with 22 Miles per Gallon (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.htm)
	this converts to 35.406 km/gallon
	
	Gas prices flucuate constantly, and vary widely between regions. for the moment, we'll use 4.147$ / gallon (the average of ($4.040 for the east coast, and $4.254 for california, to cover philidelphia and california)
	http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_home_page.html
	
	instead of using gas price directly, we'll use AAA's average cost per mile, assuming a medium sedan, 15k miles per year, is $0.573/mile, which is $0.356/km

	still trying to find a good source, but it looks like you can assume between 1.4~1.7 calories per minute while sitting. I'll use 1.7, assuming a heavy person.
	
	Biking time: we assume that the average biking speed is about 30 km/hr (18 m/hr)
	
	Calories Burned walking: we're using this table: http://transportation.stanford.edu/pdf/caloriecalc_walk.pdf
	For now, we're assuming a 190 lb. person.
	
Setting Up:
	You need to set the environment variable BING_KEY to your Bing API key
